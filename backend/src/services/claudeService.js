    You are evaluating a candidate for a job. Analyze ALL factors carefully and provide a fair assessment.

    CANDIDATE PROFILE:
    - Name: ${candidateProfile.name}
    - Skills: ${JSON.stringify(candidateProfile.skills || [])}
    - Years of Experience: ${candidateProfile.experience_years || 0}
    - Certifications: ${JSON.stringify(candidateProfile.certifications || [])}
    - Education: ${candidateProfile.education || 'Not specified'}
    - Language: ${candidateProfile.language_preference || 'English'}

    JOB POSTING:
    - Title: ${jobRequirements.title}
    - Company: ${jobRequirements.company}
    - Pay Rate: $${jobRequirements.pay}/hour
    - Location: ${jobRequirements.location}
    - Work Schedule: ${jobRequirements.schedule}
    - Job Type: ${jobRequirements.job_type || 'Not specified'}
    - Job Description: ${jobRequirements.description || 'Not provided'}
    - Requirements: ${jobRequirements.requirements || 'Not specified'}

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SKILLS MATCHING:
    You MUST extract the required skills from BOTH the "Job Description" and "Requirements" fields above.
    Look for keywords like: forklift, warehouse, customer service, bilingual, Spanish, construction, etc.
    
    Then compare the candidate's skills array with those extracted requirements.
    
    SCORING INSTRUCTIONS (total = 100 points):

    1. SKILLS MATCH (40 points) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
       - Extract skills mentioned in the job description and requirements
       - Compare with candidate's skills array
       - Look for EXACT matches (e.g., "forklift" in both)
       - Look for RELATED matches (e.g., "warehouse" relates to "inventory")
       - If candidate has 80%+ of needed skills ‚Üí 35-40 points
       - If candidate has 60-80% of needed skills ‚Üí 28-34 points
       - If candidate has 40-60% of needed skills ‚Üí 20-27 points
       - Even 1-2 key skill matches are worth 15-20 points

    2. EXPERIENCE (25 points)
       - 3+ years for most jobs ‚Üí 20-25 points
       - 1-3 years ‚Üí 12-19 points
       - Less than 1 year ‚Üí 5-11 points
       - Consider if experience level fits job complexity

    3. CERTIFICATIONS (15 points)
       - Each relevant certification is valuable
       - Industry-specific certs are highly valuable

    4. LOCATION & SCHEDULE (10 points)
       - Location compatibility
       - Schedule alignment

    5. EDUCATION & LANGUAGE (10 points)
       - Education level
       - Language compatibility (bilingual is a plus)

    CRITICAL SCORING RULES:
    - If candidate skills array contains words found in job description/requirements, score HIGH (70%+)
    - Example: Candidate has ["forklift", "warehouse"] and job needs "forklift operation" ‚Üí This is 80%+ match
    - Example: Candidate has ["customer service", "bilingual"] and job needs "Spanish speaking customer service" ‚Üí This is 90%+ match
    - DO NOT penalize small gaps - focus on what matches
    - A candidate with 2-3 key matching skills should score 75-85%
    - Only score below 60% if there are NO skill matches or major red flags

    Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations outside JSON):
    {
      "match_score": <number 0-100>,
      "reasoning": "<explain what skills matched and why score is high/low>",
      "strengths": ["<specific matching skill or quality>", "<another strength>", "<third strength>"],
      "red_flags": ["<concern if any>"] or [],
      "recommendation": "proceed_to_interview" or "maybe" or "not_a_fit"
